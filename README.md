Homework for vision course

Take other's heatmap and curve graph as referrence.

level 1 is index.html
level 2 is indexlevel2.html

Use preprocess.py and preprocess2.py for preprocessing the data to generate the new csv.
Due to trouble in reading from local files, I upload the whole work to the github
(https://github.com/Do7and/VisHomework), and use the Internet url to import the csv data.
